      <p>
When you break something up, you create things.</br>
When you create something, you destroy things.</br>
Material things have no creation or destruction.</br>
Ultimately these concepts connect as one.</br>
</p><p>
Only the enlightened know that they connect as one,</br>
So instead of debating this with your preconceptions,</br>
Approach it in an ordinary way.</br>
</p><p>
Those with this ordinary approach, simply apply the idea.</br>
Those who apply it, connect with it.</br>
Those who connect with it, attain it.</br>
This easily attained understanding is not far off.</br>
