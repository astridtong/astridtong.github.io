  <p>
  All that is limited by form, semblance, sound, color is called object.</br>
  Among them all, man alone is more than an object.</br>
  Though, like objects, he has form and semblance,</br>
  He is not limited to form: he is more.</br>
  He can attain to formlessness.</br>
 </p><p>
  When he is beyond form and semblance, beyond “this” and “that”,</br>
  where is the comparison with another object?</br>
  Where is the conflict?</br>
  What can stand in his way?</br>
  He will rest in his eternal place which is no-place.</br>
  He will be hidden in his own unfathomable secret.</br>
  His nature sinks to its root in the One.</br>
  His vitality, his power hide in secret Tao.</br>
